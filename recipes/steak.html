    <h3>These air fryer rib-eye steaks definitely rival a steak cooked on a grill.</h3>
    <p>A perfectly seared steak can seem like a daunting task. Getting the golden, crusty sear on the outside and trying not to overcook your steak can be difficult. What if we told you that your air fryer can take all of that stress away? </p>
    <p>Guess what? It can! Pop that steak into the air fryer and leave it to cook that steak to a perfect medium rare without splattering your stove with oil or filling your kitchen with smoke. And with that extra time you just gave yourself, why not stir up a little herb butter or make yourself some crispy Air Fryer Potatoes to go along with your perfectly cooked steak? It’s not mandatory, but it sure is delicious.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 rib-eye steaks, cut 1 1/2-inch thick</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons grill seasoning (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine steaks, soy sauce, olive oil, and seasoning in a large resealable bag. Marinate meat for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove steaks from bag and discard the marinade. Pat excess oil off the steaks.</li>
            <li>Add about 1 tablespoon water to the bottom of the air fryer pan to prevent it from smoking during the cooking process.</li>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Add steaks to air fryer and cook for 7 minutes. Turn steaks and cook for another 7 monutes until seak is medium rare. For a medium steak, increase the total cook time to 16 minutes, flipping steak after 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove steaks, keep warm, and let sit for about 4 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
